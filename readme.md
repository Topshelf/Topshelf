### Source

 1. Clone the source down to your machine.
   `git clone git://github.com/Topshelf/Topshelf.git`
 2. Download git, ruby and gems. Install â€“ a tutorial is [here][gems]
 3. gem install rake albacore
 4. **Important:** Run `rake global_version` in order to generate the SolutionVersion.cs file which is otherwise missing.
	* You must have git on the path in order to do this. (Right click on `Computer` > `Advanced System Settings`, `Advanced` (tab) > `Environment Variables...` > Append the git executable's directory at the end of the PATH environment variable.
 5. Edit with Visual Studio 2010 or alternatively edit and run `rake`. `rake help` displays all possible tasks that you can run. The `package` task, is what the build server does.
 6. The default is .Net 4.0. At the moment, editing the solution file for .Net 3.5 requires the "fix" below.

[gems]: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html  "How to use ruby/gems"

#### Editing in Visual Studio

 1. Run `rake global_version` in the root folder.
 2. Set Visual Studio Tools -> Options -> Text Editor -> All Languages -> Tabs to use "Tab Size" = 4, "Indent Size" = 4, and "Insert Spaces"
 3. Double-click/open the .sln file.

 You can alternatively edit and build for .Net 3.5 instead of .Net 4.0 with this step:

 * Edit all `TopShelf/src/**/*.csproj` files at the top of the files, where it says:
    `<TargetFrameworkVersion Condition=" '$(TargetFrameworkVersion)' == '' ">v4.0</TargetFrameworkVersion>`

   Change `v4.0` to `v3.5`. The build script itself won't be affected by this change, but it'll help Visual Studio know what version we're building for.
  3. Edit Topshelf.Host/app.config and uncomment the supportedRuntime- and runtime-elements.

#### Editing the rake script

 * Getting an overview: `rake help`
 * Getting descriptions of the tasks: `rake -P`
 * Read some articles; currently we need help with environments configuration and reducing the noise in tasks by making the files FileTask-s themselves. Some of this stuff is discussed [here][fowler-rake].

In general you should define your tasks to have the least number of dependencies to function. Paths should be placed in the props dictionary at the start of the rake file.

# REQUIREMENTS

To run the build, rake, .NET 3.5, and .NET 4.0 are required. To open the solution, you must have Visual Studio 2010 Service Pack 1.
